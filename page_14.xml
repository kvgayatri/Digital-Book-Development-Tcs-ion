On the other hand, there are many constraints for the usage of available bandwidth such as: capacity of the communication channel, speed of UAVs, error-prone structure of the wireless links and lack of security with broadcast communication. A FANET protocol must satisfy the bandwidth capacity requirement so that it can relay very high resolution real time image or video under several constraints.]]></pText>

•	Inter-plane Communication – In Figure 5.5 there are three planes for FANET. The communication between UAVs in one plane and UAVs of another plane is called inter-plane communication.</li>
<li>•	Intra-plane Communication – The communication between UAVs of the same plane is known as intra-plane communication.</li>
<li>•	Ground Station Communication – This is the communication between UAVs of any plane to the ground or base station.</li>
<li>•	Ground Sensor Communication - This is the communication between UAVs in any plane to the sensors on the ground.</li></ul>]]></pText>
