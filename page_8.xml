        <pText><![CDATA[Mesh topology can be again classified as (a) flat mesh configuration (b) hierarchical mesh configuration. In a flat mesh configuration, all nodes are interconnected and one node will be connected to the ground station. In hierarchical mesh configuration, there will be several mesh groups and each mesh group will be at different hierarchy. One node from the mesh group at a lowest hierarchy will be connected to the ground station. Figure 5.3 (a) shows a flat mesh configuration and Figure 5.3(b) shows a hierarchical mesh configuration. Mesh configurations are flexible, reliable and more secure compared to star configurations. Table
5.2 shows a comparison between star network configuration and mesh network configuration]]></pText>
